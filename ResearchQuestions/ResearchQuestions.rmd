### Key Koncept: Research Question

A **research question** is a question...

1. that *can be answered* and
2. for which having that answer will *improve our understanding of how the world works*

A research questions takes us from a **theory** to an **hypothesis** that we can check using real world data. The data may provide **evidence** in favor or against our hypothesis.

# Research questions &mdash; Examples

.vcenter[

### Example: The influence of smartphone usage on children

- Does heavy smartphone usage damage children's eyesight?

- Does smartphone usage stimulate creative or intellectual activity?

- Does smartphone usage reduce children's ability to concentrate?

# Why not simply look for patterns in the data?

<br>

- We are living in an information economy, surrounding us by an increasing amount of readily available data

- Why not skip hassling with theories and research questions and simply look for *patterns* in the data?

- A lot of people do &mdash; this commonly referred to as **data mining**

.blockquote[
### Definition: Data Mining
Data mining is the systematic application of computer-aided methods to discover patterns, trends or correlations in (often large and connected) data sets. Algorithms based on statistical methods are frequently used for this purpose.

# Data mining

... is a useful toolkit if we care more about the *what* rather than the *why*: 

- Data mining is often good at

    - making *predictions under stability*.

    -  finding patterns in the data. These may foster research questions that we can examine further in other data sources.
    
- Data mining is less good at

    - helping to come up with a good theory or to improve an existing one. 
    
    - producing valid inference. It has a tendency to find **false positives**.<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> A false positive is a result that incorrectly indicates the presence of a condition under examination.

# Data mining &mdash; Predictions under stability

.vcenter[
.blockquote[

### Example: Predicting die roll outcomes

- By a stable mechanism we mean that the process giving us the data does not change.

- If the process is "rolling a six-sided die" data mining would based on a thousand rolls would be great at predicting that the probability of observing a 1 is 1/6. 

- If the process switches to "rolling a twenty-sided", that data mining prediction will be bad. It will still predict a 1/6 chance of a 1 until it gets a lot more data. 

- Probability theory will properly predict the switch to a 1/20 chance immediately.

# Data mining &mdash; Looking for Patterns 

.vcenter[
.blockquote[

### Example: Viagra &mdash; Looking

**To find a pattern can make you rich**

- Pfizer scientists originally developed Viagra scientists to mitigate high blood pressure and angina.

- Famous side effects have been found using data mining: instead of coming to the data with a theory, the scientists noticed an interesting pattern in the data.

**Data mining is bad as a final step**

- Taking a pattern found as given would be problematic 

- Pfizer did clinical studies to *see if the pattern replicated*: they verified an hypothesis derived from their research question using experimental data.

# So what makes a research question a *good* one?

**Simplicity**

  - Do not bundle a bunch of research questions into one.
    
  - Consider potential answers&mdash; research question and theory probably do not align very well if we cannot place potential answers within the framework of our theory.

**Feasibility / scalability **

  - A good research question can be answered using the right data. 
    
  - Data acquisition is often subject to constraints. Think time, money, data protection laws.

**Suitable research design**

  - The research design must be suitable to investigate the derived hypothesis.
  
  - Thoughtful consideration must be given as to which statistical method is appropriate. We will deal with this aspect in particular in this course.
